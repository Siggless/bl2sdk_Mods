# Tutorial
## How to Add a Map
Simply move the map file ``{name}.json`` into the ``Maps`` folder.  
The map will then show up ingame in the ``Mods`` settings menu.  

## Threaded Loading
Creating and moving lots of objects obviously takes some time. Because this will always happen upon map load completion, 
it can drastically decrease farming times. To overcome the increased map loading times you can use the ``Threaded Loading`` 
mod setting. This option will slowly load in all map changes over time. 
As a side effect you will not see all final map changes upon map load completion. You might see some pop ins.

By Default the ``Threaded Loading`` option is disabled.

# Included Maps

## [Bloodshot Parkour](maps/Bloodshot_Parkour)
Bloodshot Parkour is a 7 room big parkour map. Each room has 1 secret vault symbol and skull to discover.  
Furtheremore there is also 1 super secret teddy bear head to find hidden anywhere.  
As a reward for completing the map the final room is a Knoxx style armory with lots of chests.  

! Some parts of the map might not be doable if you are playing ``Krieg`` or ``Zer0``.
Krieg is too heavy for certain jumps and Zer0 is too big for some places.

To play this map you need to travel to ``Bloodshot Stronghold``.

Rules:
1) Use any character except Krieg and Zer0
2) No grenade jumping
3) No rocket jumping
4) No speed skills
5) Don't drop gear on the floor or it will fall through the map
