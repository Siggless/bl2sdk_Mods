# BLImgui
A [PythonSDK](https://github.com/bl-sdk/PythonSDK) library that wraps boilerplate code for [pyimgui](https://github.com/pyimgui/pyimgui).  
This library allows modders to easily create and interact with a new opengl window with an existing imgui context.  
This mod is a spiritual successor to my [PyImgui SDK Mod](https://github.com/juso40/bl2sdk_Mods/tree/master/PyImgui).

## Instalation
1. Download the mod [here](https://github.com/juso40/bl2sdk_Mods/raw/master/blimgui/blimgui.zip)
2. Extract the archive into your `Borderlands 2\Binaries\Win32\Mods` directory
